## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.6 or higher**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip**: Usually comes with Python installations, used for package management.

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or any terminal emulator) and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-powered-data-analysis.git
   cd ai-powered-data-analysis
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Required Packages: Install the necessary Python packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
Once the installation is complete, you can run the application using Streamlit:

Start the Streamlit Application: In your terminal, run:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Access the Application: After running the command, your default web browser should open automatically to the Streamlit interface, typically at http://localhost:8501.

Uploading Data
Locate the Upload Section: On the Streamlit interface, find the section labeled "Upload CSV File".

Select Your Data: Click the "Browse" button to locate and select the CSV file you wish to analyze.

Upload the File: Once selected, the data will automatically load into the system for processing.

Performing Analysis
Choose Analysis Type: After uploading your data, select the type of analysis you wish to perform (e.g., regression, classification).

Configure Parameters: Adjust any necessary parameters based on your analysis needs. This may include selecting features, tuning model parameters, etc.

Run the Analysis: Click the "Analyze" button to execute the analysis. The system will process the data using the selected machine learning algorithms.

Visualizing Results
View Outputs: After the analysis completes, results will be displayed in the designated output section of the interface.

Interactive Visualizations: Use the interactive charts and graphs to explore trends, patterns, and key findings from your analysis.

Download Results: If provided, use the download button to save the analysis results to your local machine.

Troubleshooting
Application Not Starting: Ensure you are running the application in the correct directory and that all dependencies are installed.
CSV Upload Issues: Make sure your CSV file is properly formatted and does not contain excessive missing values.
Performance Issues: If the application runs slowly, consider optimizing your dataset size or the complexity of the analysis.
